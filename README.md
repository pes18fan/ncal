## Contributing

At this point, I consider this project to be more or less feature complete; it's 
not much more than a simple app to check the date. However, many parts of the code 
(including the way date conversion is done) is fairly hacky so feel free to 
contribute if you have a better way, found an issue in it, or just want to add 
something new!

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/pes18fan/ncal/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
